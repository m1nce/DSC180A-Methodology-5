### Questions
1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
  - The concept of having a bottleneck layer that predicts concepts to create an overall prediction at the end of the neural layer output was really interesting, especially doing so without putting in manual labels into the model.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
  - I would love to investigate the images the model actually thinks of when the concept bottleneck layer is created. Another point of investigation could be more computer-vision centered by looking into what the model "sees" when the image is distorted through blurring/missing pixels.
3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
  - Not much, rather than more specific deep diving into material.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using your project?
  - Computer vision, more NLP, other modern artificial intelligence ideas.
